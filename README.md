# ITAM Education

An open-source Learning Management System for student-to-student courses. Built by and for the [ITAM](https://itatmisis.ru) community.

## ‚ú® Features

### üìö Courses

ITAM Education enables any authorized community member to create a fully customizable course. Within a course, teachers organize content into lessons that may include theoretical materials, video content or an associated video call room. Homework assignments can be added to any lesson, and the built-in review system lets teachers provide personalized feedback to the student submissions.

### ‚òéÔ∏è Video Calls

The platform features video calls with recording and screen sharing capabilities. Calls that are related to a specific lesson automatically report student attendance, and video recording is shown on the lesson page after the call ends.

The integrated Telegram bot allows users to log in to the web platform, and receive real-time notifications about upcoming lessons, homework deadlines, calls, and other important updates directly through Telegram.

ITAM Education platform consists of multiple packages that communicate over HTTP.

### üíª Baremetal

While a non-containerized setup on Linux is theoretically possible, it is not officially supported. Refer to Docker Compose configuration for guidance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

Development happens inside a [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). VS Code is a recommended editor of choice.

- Clone repository and open it in a devcontainer
- Install dependencies via `npm ci`
- Configure environment
    - Create a Telegram bot to use during local development
    - Copy `.env.example` as `.env` and fill all variables related to Telegram. Other variables may be skipped.
- Start services in development mode via `Run and Debug` menu (F5 in VS Code)
- Run `task` in the Terminal to see the list of available commands.
