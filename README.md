# ITAM Education

An open-source Learning Management System for student-to-student courses. Built by and for the [ITAM](https://itatmisis.ru) community.

## ‚ú® Features

### üìö Courses

ITAM Education enables any authorized community member to create a fully customizable course. Within a course, teachers organize content into lessons that may include theoretical materials, video content or an associated video call room. Homework assignments can be added to any lesson, and the built-in review system lets teachers provide personalized feedback to the student submissions.

### ‚òéÔ∏è Video Calls

The platform features video calls with recording and screen sharing capabilities. Calls that are related to a specific lesson automatically report student attendance, and video recording is shown on the lesson page after the call ends.
